# Gamedev experiments

I've always had a fascination with game development but never found the motivation to stick with it.

In my previous attempts, I tried learning OpenGL directly which was fun but also a pain. I've also played around with Unity quite a bit, but at this point I don't enjoy spending my time coding on statically typed languages, especially not C#.

So this time I'm trying LÃ–VE and Lua.
